             </P>
<P>DUFF is not your everyday duplicate file finder. It was 
designed to be more configurable than almost anyone would ever need. Its modular 
design allows features to be added very easily as plugins or as built-in modules.</P>
<P>          
         You'll be amazed to 
see how much disk space windows wastes by keeping multiple copies of files around.</P>
<P>          
      If you archive any types of files, 
such as: sound files, images, ROMs, or anything else, DUFF is great for you.</P>

      <P><U>method of determining the "equality" of two 
      files</U><BR>        Examples:<BR>File Size - files are 
      "equal" if their sizes are the same<BR>File Data - files are "equal" if 
      they contain the same data<BR>File Name - files are "equal" if their

    <TD><U>filters out files you don't want to check for 
      duplicates</U> <BR>Examples:<BR>If you want to ignore all files that are 0 
      bytes (blank), then you could configure the File Size filter to include 
      only files whose sizes are not equal to 0.<BR>If you want to only look at 
      files that were created before today, you could configure the File Data 
      filter to include only those files that were created before today </TD></TR>

    <TD width="200" style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"><STRONG>File Marker</STRONG></TD>
    <TD>
      <P><U>marks, or flags certain files</U><BR>Lets say you downloaded a bunch 
      of files from multiple sources. Some files had the same filenames and so 
      you get files with filenames like this: my movie.avi<BR>Copy (1) of my 
      movie.avi<BR>movie[1].avi<BR>movie.avi<BR>picture.bmp<BR>picture2.bmp<BR>Since 
      you don't need 2 copies of any of these files, you want to delete the 
      second copies. So, you can use the Filename Marker to mark all files with 
      the longest filename and then you can use the file delete processor to 
      delete the marked files, which will leave you with:<BR>my 
      movie.avi<BR>movie.avi<BR>picture.bmp<BR>No more duplicates!</P></TD></TR>
